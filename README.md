## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.  Solution need to process images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
# Approach
Build CNN architecture and train it on Training data. Evaluate the accuracy of model on Validation data set using accuracy and loss curves. Make changes to the model to avoid overfitting or under fitting. To reduced overfitting data is rebalanced and also syntheic data is cretaed.
